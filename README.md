A Random Number Generator

I'm sure there are a million random number generators online and this is my version, using Python and Tkinter.

* Enter the amount of numbers required
* Pick a lowest and highest number
* Choose whether the numbers should be unique
* Generate!

Not very exciting, but it was the first thing I wrote (I wonder why :smile:), initially just as a terminal program, then later converted to Tkinter.

**Requirements**

python3, python3-tk
